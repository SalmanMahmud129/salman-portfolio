            After acquiring basic understanding of beginner programming concepts from Stony Brook University and later completing Flatiron Schoolâ€™s Software Engineering Program, I am now confident in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript/React based programming along with obtaining proficiency in any new stacks that are required for my personal or employed goals. My experience has equipped me with arguably the most important skill for the field of Software Engineering: how to learn independently and grow as a life-long student.
